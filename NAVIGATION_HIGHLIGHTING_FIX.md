# Navigation Highlighting Fix

## Problem
After optimizing the website for performance, the navigation bar highlighting stopped working when scrolling. The navigation would only highlight when clicking buttons, but not when manually scrolling to sections.

## Root Cause
During performance optimization, we removed the scroll-based section detection system that was responsible for updating the navigation highlight based on which section is currently visible in the viewport.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **High-Performance Intersection Observer**
Added a smart intersection observer system that detects which section is currently visible:

```javascript
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  (entries) => {
    // Skip updates during manual navigation to prevent conflicts
    if (isNavigating) return;
    
    // Find the section that's most visible
    let maxVisibility = 0;
    let mostVisibleSection = 'home';
    
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting && entry.intersectionRatio > maxVisibility) {
        maxVisibility = entry.intersectionRatio;
        const sectionId = entry.target.id;
        if (sections.includes(sectionId)) {
          mostVisibleSection = sectionId;
        }
      }
    });
    
    // Only update if we found a visible section and it's different from current
    if (maxVisibility > 0.1 && mostVisibleSection !== activeSection) {
      setActiveSection(mostVisibleSection);
    }
  },
  {
    threshold: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7], // Multiple thresholds for better detection
    rootMargin: '-80px 0px -50% 0px' // Account for header and focus on upper part of viewport
  }
);
```

### 2. **Smart Conflict Prevention**
- **During navigation**: Intersection observer is disabled to prevent conflicts
- **After navigation**: Small delay (200ms) before re-enabling section detection
- **Smooth handoff**: Ensures click navigation takes priority over scroll detection

### 3. **Robust Section Detection**
- **Multiple thresholds**: Uses 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 for accurate detection
- **Smart margins**: Accounts for fixed header (-80px top) and focuses on upper viewport
- **Fallback system**: Retries section detection if elements aren't ready initially

### 4. **Performance Optimized**
- **Non-blocking**: Uses intersection observer instead of scroll events
- **Efficient**: Only updates when sections actually change
- **Memory safe**: Properly cleans up observers on component unmount

## How It Works

### Scroll-Based Highlighting
1. **User scrolls** manually through the page
2. **Intersection observer** detects which section is most visible
3. **Navigation highlight** updates automatically to match current section
4. **Smooth transitions** between section highlights

### Click-Based Navigation
1. **User clicks** navigation button
2. **Immediate highlight** update for instant feedback
3. **Smooth scroll** to target section
4. **Observer disabled** during navigation to prevent conflicts
5. **Observer re-enabled** after navigation completes

## Testing
Run the navigation highlighting test:
```bash
npm run dev
node test-navigation-highlighting.js
```

Expected results:
- âœ… **Scroll highlighting**: Navigation updates when scrolling between sections
- âœ… **Click navigation**: Buttons work and highlight correctly
- âœ… **Smooth transitions**: No jarring highlight changes
- âœ… **Performance**: No lag or FPS drops

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience**
- **Always accurate**: Navigation always shows current section
- **Intuitive**: Works exactly as users expect
- **Responsive**: Updates immediately when scrolling
- **Consistent**: Same behavior on all devices

### âš¡ **Performance**
- **Efficient**: Uses intersection observer (better than scroll events)
- **Non-blocking**: Doesn't interfere with animations
- **Optimized**: Only updates when necessary
- **Memory safe**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### ðŸ”§ **Maintainable**
- **Robust**: Handles edge cases and timing issues
- **Flexible**: Easy to add/remove sections
- **Debuggable**: Clear logic flow and error handling
- **Future-proof**: Uses modern web APIs

## Browser Support
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full intersection observer support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support (iOS 12.2+)
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

The navigation highlighting now works perfectly for both scroll-based and click-based interactions while maintaining the high performance optimizations! ðŸš€
