# Alumni Images

This directory contains profile images for The Game Forge alumni members.

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Dimensions**: 600x700px (portrait orientation preferred)
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Naming**: Use format `alumni-[id].jpg` (e.g., `alumni-1.jpg`)

## Current Alumni Images

The alumni section currently uses placeholder images. Replace these with actual alumni photos:

- `alumni-1.jpg` - Arjun Sharma (Former President, now at Ubisoft India)
- `alumni-2.jpg` - Priya Patel (Technical Artist at Rockstar Games)
- `alumni-3.jpg` - Rahul Kumar (Indie Game Developer)
- `alumni-4.jpg` - Sneha Reddy (Game Designer at Electronic Arts)
- `alumni-5.jpg` - Vikram Singh (Senior Software Engineer at Unity Technologies)
- `alumni-6.jpg` - Ananya Gupta (Product Manager at Supercell)

## Adding New Alumni

1. Add the alumni image to this directory
2. Update the `src/data/alumni.json` file with the new alumni information
3. Update the image path in the JSON to point to the new image

## Image Optimization

All images should be optimized for web delivery. Consider using tools like:
- ImageOptim (macOS)
- TinyPNG (online)
- Next.js automatic image optimization handles the rest
